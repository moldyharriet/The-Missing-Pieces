# The Missing Pieces
Incredibly basic application to take notes on Elden Ring, or other RPGs that function in a similar fashion.

Obviously, created as a learning experience, not something actually intended to be used, unless someone desires to.

Known Bugs: Moving .txt files out of The Missing Pieces folder prevents the program from opening the notetaking window

Known Workarounds: Don't take .txt files out of The Missing Pieces folder until fix is present.
